        <h2>How It Started?</h2>
        <p>
          At MacLaren's, Barney, Marshall, and Lily criticize Ted for
          overthinking every aspect of his life, rather than simply acting on a
          whim. Barney convinces Ted to take five shots of bartender Carl's
          special blend called "Red Dragon;" Ted claims that he can still
          function cognitively even under the influence of the alcohol, but
          shortly afterwards he blacks out. He wakes up the next morning with a
          girl he does not remember beside him in bed, a pineapple on his
          nightstand, a sprained ankle and his coat partially burnt. Ted asks
          Marshall and Lily about the night and they tell him that he sang along
          with the jukebox in the bar while standing on a table. He also
          repeatedly drunk dialed Robin, who was on a date with a wealthy
          businessman. He fell off the table, spraining his ankle and Marshall
          and Lily took him up to his bed. However, they are surprised when Ted
          asks about the girl on the bed and can shed no light on the pineapple
          or why Ted's coat is burnt.

        <h2>And The Night Goes On</h2>
        <p>
          Ted calls Barney, thinking that he might know what happened the night
          before but finds him sprawled in their bathtub. Barney recounts that
          Ted reappeared at the bar around 1 a.m., but when he began to call
          Robin again, Barney lit Ted's coat on fire. After some more time spent
          at the bar, he put Ted back into bed, although similarly has no idea
          who the mystery girl is. Ted finds that someone wrote on his arm,
          saying to call the number if Ted was found passed out somewhere. Ted
          calls the number and reaches Carl, who fills in some more of the
          story: Ted again returned to the bar at 3 a.m., but Carl refused to
          serve him. Ted told Carl the meaning of the word "karaoke" and that he
          wanted to go see some penguins at the zoo, then suddenly called
          someone and told her come over and do something "crazy". Based on this
          information, Marshall, Lily, and Barney believe that the mysterious
          girl in Ted's bed is actually Robin, but as Ted goes to wake her up,
          Robin calls and tells him she is coming over to discuss the previous
          night.

        <h2>The FINALE:</h2>
        <p>
          The girl in bed, Trudy (Danica McKellar), wakes up and explains her
          side of the story: she had seen Ted's drunken dancing and they
          exchanged numbers in the ladies' room of the bar, which Ted had
          entered and used accidentally. She told Ted the meaning of the word
          "karaoke" and about her love for penguins, which Ted later mentioned
          to Carl. It was she whom he later called and invited over, not Robin.
          Ted tells Trudy to hide when Robin comes over to talk, and Trudy
          leaves via the fire escape before Ted can show her to Robin to prove
          that he has moved on. Future Ted explains that Trudy never responded
          to his subsequent message, and he never did work out where the
          pineapple came from, but that it was delicious.
